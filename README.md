**SETTING UP YOUR DATABASE**

- uncomment the following line in your php.ini file: 
`extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll`

- make sure your app/config/parameters.yml file looks like this:
```
parameters:
    database_driver: pdo_mysql
    database_host: localhost
    database_port: null
    database_name: cms6
    database_user: root
    database_password: null
    mailer_transport: smtp
    mailer_host: 127.0.0.1
    mailer_user: null
    mailer_password: null

**RUNNING MIGRATIONS** (https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMigrationsBundle/index.html)

- make sure app/AppKernel.php has the following:
```
public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        //...
        new Doctrine\Bundle\MigrationsBundle\DoctrineMigrationsBundle(),
    );
}
```
- run the following in the command line: 
`composer require doctrine/doctrine-migrations-bundle "^1.0"`

        "platform": {
            "php": "7.0.2"
        }
    }
```
- you should now be able to apply migrations: 
`php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`

- check http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ to make sure the tables were properly created

**CHANGING TABLES / CREATING MIGRATIONS**

- Create a table with the following command: 
`php app/console doctrine:generate:entitiy`

After editing DB tables, make sure to do the following:

- Generate the getter/setter methods using the following command (or write them manually): 
`php app/console doctrine:generate:entities AppBundle`

- Generate and apply the new migration scripts (WARNING: YOU COULD LOSE DATA THAT'S STORED IN THE DB):
```
php app/console doctrine:migrations:diff
php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

**FOSuserbundle Setup**

You can find more detailed instructions here: https://symfony.com/doc/master/bundles/FOSUserBundle/index.html

To download FOSUserBundle use composer:
```
composer require friendsofsymfony/user-bundle "~2.0@dev"
```

loginBranch has already setup the AppKernel.php, routing, config and security.yml parts

Visit http://localhost/Symfony/cms6/web/app_dev.php/login to see the login page (will look very ugly right now).

You may need to update your database to use the already created test account:
Username: usertest
Password: passtest

**VichUploader Setup**

Go to https://github.com/dustin10/VichUploaderBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/installation.md


**CREATE DEFAULT ADMIN USER**

composer require --dev doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle

Load the admin user fixture
(write this into your terminal or command prompt window)
php app/console doctrine:fixtures:load

* this will delete all existing user records. If there are any records you'd like to keep enter this instead
php app/console â€”append doctrine:fixtures:load
